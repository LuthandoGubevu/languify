const poemA = `From ocean‚Äôs wave a Wanderer came,
With visage tanned and dun:
His Mother, when he told his name,
Scarce knew her long-lost son;
So altered was his face and frame
By the ill course he had run.

There was hot fever in his blood,
And dark thoughts in his brain;
And oh! to turn his heart to good
That Mother strove in vain,
For fierce and fearful was his mood,
Racked by remorse and pain.

And if, at times, a gleam more mild
Would o‚Äôer his features stray,
When knelt the Widow near her Child,
And he tried with her to pray,
It lasted not ‚Äì for visions wild
Still scared good thoughts away.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs blood upon my hands!‚Äù he said,
‚ÄúWhich water cannot wash;
It was not shed where warriors bled‚Äî
It dropped from the gory lash,
As I whirled it o‚Äôer and o‚Äôer my head,
And with each stroke left a gash.

With every stroke I left a gash,
While Negro blood sprang high;
And now all ocean cannot wash
My soul from murder‚Äôs dye;
Nor e‚Äôen thy prayer, dear Mother, quash
That Woman‚Äôs wild death-cry!

Her cry is ever in my ear,
And it will not let me pray;
Her look I see ‚Äì her voice I hear ‚Äì
As when in death she lay,
And said, ‚ÄúWith me thou must appear
On God‚Äôs great Judgment-day!‚Äù`;

const poemB = `Words are everywhere
daily
we read them, and they fly out
like nobody‚Äôs business when we are provoked ‚Ä¶

but there‚Äôs always something hard to understand ‚Ä¶

they are hard to find
when they are needed by the heart;
when the heart feels,
words hide like they are not part of life.

While words are busy playing some twisted game
my heart looks sadly through the glass windows
as the raindrops slowly slide down, gently
on a cloudy lifetime,
hoping that one day,
words will realize what my heart wants to say.`;
