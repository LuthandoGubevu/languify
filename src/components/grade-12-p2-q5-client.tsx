const extractI = `So I told him, I expected him to feel sorry for me and offer his help but instead he said:
'You cannot allow your home situation to control you. You have to control your situation.'
I was very angry. How could he say that? It was so easy for him to judge me when he lived in a nice house, drove a nice car and didn't worry about where his next meal was going to come from.
'But how?' was all I could manage to say to him.
'Focus,' he said, and that drove me up the wall.
'Sir I really think that I should leave now; it is one thing to act concerned but making a mockery of me is more that I am willing to take,' I said and walked towards the door.
'Thulisile wait ...' he said, but I kept on walking.
The following day I did not go to school, and I told myself that I was never going back.
I knew that Mr Nkwane would tell everybody about my situation and the last thing I wanted from them was their pity, because it was not going to feed me, put clothes on my back or even help me in getting my school work on track.
Besides the fact that I was poor didn't mean that I didn't have pride.`;

const extractJ = `'Oh, he's no trouble,' Sejosenye would reply.
They began to laugh at his third phase. Almost overnight he turned into a tall spindly-legged, graceful gazelle with large, grave eyes.
There was an odd, musical lilt to his speech and when he teased, or was up to mischief, he moved his head on his long thin neck from side to side like a cobra.
It was he who became the king of kings of all the boys in his area; he could turn his hand to anything and made the best wire cars with their wheels of shoe-polish tins.
All his movements were neat, compact, decisive, and for his age he was a boy who knew his own mind.
They laughed at his knowingness and certainty on all things, for he was like the grandmother who had had a flaming youth all her own too.
Sejosenye had scandalised the whole village in her days of good morals by leaving her own village ward to live with a married man in Ga-Sefete-Molemo ward.
She had won him from his wife and married him and then lived down the scandal in the way only natural queens can.
Even in old age, she was still impressive. She sailed through the village, head in the air, with a quiet, almost expressionless face.`;
